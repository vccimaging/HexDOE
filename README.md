# HexDOE
Source code for hexagonal wave propagation and phase retrieval for hexagonal DOE design
The implementation is based on PyTorch which supports efficient gradient propagation.
### Prerequisite
PyTorch, Matplotlib, Numpy
### Examples
[Example 0](https://github.com/vccimaging/HexDOE/blob/main/demo_0_forward_simulation.ipynb): To create the field in hexagonal coordinates and propagate the field.

[Example 1](https://github.com/vccimaging/HexDOE/blob/main/demo_1_inverse_design.ipynb): Phase retrieval solved by back-propagation and Gerchberg-Saxton.
